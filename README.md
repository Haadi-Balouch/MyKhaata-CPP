## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Implemented

- **Abstract Classes** â€“ Common interface for user types (`Person`)
- **Inheritance** â€“ Derived classes for `User` and `Admin`
- **Polymorphism** â€“ Virtual functions for dynamic behavior
- **Encapsulation** â€“ Structured and secure class design
- **Modularity** â€“ Separation of concerns across classes
